# Java Assignment

Backend API created with Spring Boot framework for technical assignment. 

## Task Requirement
```
1. These API should be written in Java language, with at least version 17 or higher.
2. Apply Spring Boot framework.
3. Create a RESTful API with the following endpoints:
- GET /users: Retrieve a list of all users.
- GET /users/{userId}: Retrieve details of a specific user.
- POST /users: Create a new user.
- PUT /users/{userId}: Update details of a specific user.
- DELETE /users/{userId}: Delete a specific user.
4. Use the user data from here as the data model.
5. Validation: Ensure that all required fields are provided when crating or updating a user.
6. Response Format: Use JSON for request and response bodies, include appropriate
HTTP status codes for success and errors scenarios.
```
### Bonus Tasks
```
1. Add unit tests for those API endpoints. ✔️
2. Write a Dockerfile for wrapping up those services as a Docker container. ✔️
3. Write a CI/CD script for deployment in any preferred framework/platform. ❌ (It exceeds the assignment time's limit 😭)
```
